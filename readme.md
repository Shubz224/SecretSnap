## Introduction
Image-Based Steganography is a secure method of hiding secret information within an image file. This project utilizes cryptographic techniques to encrypt messages and embed them within image files, ensuring confidentiality and data integrity. By harnessing the power of image processing and encryption algorithms, this application provides a unique solution to the challenge of secure communication.

## Description
The Image-Based Steganography project allows users to perform two primary operations: encrypting a message and embedding it within an image, and decrypting the message from an image file. This innovative approach not only secures sensitive information but also retains the visual integrity of the host image, making it indistinguishable from the original.

The core principle of this project is based on the least significant bit (LSB) method, where the message is embedded into the least significant bits of the image pixels. Coupled with robust encryption mechanisms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), the project ensures that unauthorized access to the hidden messages is highly improbable.

### Why I Built It
In today's digital landscape, data breaches and privacy concerns are increasingly prevalent. The idea behind this project stemmed from a personal interest in secure communication methods. I wanted to create a tool that not only demonstrates practical applications of cryptography but also showcases how everyday digital assets, like images, can be utilized to protect sensitive information. By developing this project, I aim to contribute to the growing need for privacy-preserving solutions, encouraging users to communicate more securely.

## Features
- **Image Encryption**: Users can upload an image file, input a message, and specify an encryption key to securely hide their message within the image. The encryption process ensures that even if the image is intercepted, the message remains confidential.
- **Image Decryption**: Users can easily retrieve the hidden message by providing the encrypted image and the correct decryption key. This feature highlights the project's ease of use while maintaining robust security.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application boasts a clean and intuitive user interface, designed with usability in mind. Users can navigate through the application with minimal effort, ensuring a seamless experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, meaning it functions flawlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures accessibility for all users, regardless of their device preferences.
- **Error Handling**: The application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms, providing users with informative feedback in case of incorrect inputs or issues during the encryption/decryption process.

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload**: Users begin by selecting an image file they wish to use for encryption. The application supports various image formats, ensuring versatility in usage.
2. **Input Message**: Users enter the message they want to hide within the image. This message can be of varying lengths, depending on the size of the image used.
3. **Encryption Process**: The application employs AES, a symmetric encryption algorithm, to encrypt the message. The encrypted data is then embedded into the image using the least significant bit method, altering only the least significant bits of the pixels to ensure the visual representation of the image remains unchanged.
4. **Decryption Process**: To retrieve the hidden message, users upload the encrypted image and provide the correct decryption key. The application extracts the relevant bits from the image, decrypts the message using AES, and displays it to the user.
